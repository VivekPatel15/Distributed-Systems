1. Vivek Patel / April 23, 2019:

2. Java build 1.8.0_201

3. Precise command-line compilation examples / instructions:

> javac JokeServer.java
> javac JokeClient.java
> javac JokeClientAdmin.java

or
> javac *.java
works too

4. Precise examples / instructions to run this program:

In separate shell windows:

> java JokeServer
> java JokeClient
> java JokeClientAdmin

All acceptable commands are displayed on the various consoles.

This runs across machines, in which case you have to pass the IP address of
the server to the clients. For exmaple, if the server is running at
140.192.1.22 then you would type:

> java JokeClient 140.192.1.22
> java JokeClientAdmin 140.192.1.22

5. List of files needed for running the program.

 a. JokeServer.java
 b. JokeClient.java
 c. JokeClientAdmin.java

5. Notes:

AdminLooper and implementation in main() method comes from Prof. Elliotâ€™s code:
http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/joke/joke-threads.html

Joke Client Admin can shut down the server, but if you want to start it again, you
can't without re-running the program. Also, the Admin controls are posted in the console, but 
it does not switch states with the <enter> button alone.

The state is stored on the Client using 2 separate Lists. It is very sloppy, but it worked for me.
The Client makes a list of integers, which is then copied to 2 separate lists: one for jokes and 
one for proverbs. The state lists are then shuffled. We take the first of both lists and send it to
the Server. The Server takes these indexes and picks the one corresponding to the mode and sends it
to the appropriate output method. Then the joke/proverb that has the same index as the Client's is 
sent along with the index and a large number back to the client. The Client then processes this by 
printing out the joke/proverb, removing the index from the temp list that it came from (which is 
determined by comparing the index and the large number) and then checking if the temp list is empty.
If the temp list is empty, then the appropriate cycle completion is annouced and the temp list is 
repopulated and shuffled using the master list.
